PHP - Carrier Pigeon
=====================

Carrier pigeon aims to be an open source alternative to services such as IFTTT (If True Then That), and Yahoo Pipes, written in PHP. A platform to allow for taking posts, messages, or content from one source and carrying them over and delivering them into another.

Planned Features Include:
 * Pluggable interface for sources: User created plugins to allow for designing and integrating any service you want with a plugin hiarchael system. 
 * Filters: Filters to parse content to help decide how different content should be handled and shared.
 * Authentications: Support for multiple types of user authentications such as OAUTH, http authentication or whatever other authentication a service may require all while supporting multiple user accounts per service provider.
 * Intuitive: To try and keep the entire process as easy to run, install and manage.
 * Self hosted solution. No need to rely or trust a 3rd party to manage and store your credentials or connect your social profiles.
 * Allow for advanced url handling / custom url shortening services.

Why:

With the ever expanding number of social platforms, sharing content between user communities in an equivelent means is becoming increasingly more important. For instance if posting, liking a picture on twitter or reddit and wanting to share that on tumblr or a users wordpress blog, it would be ideal the post type be identified and treated as such. Likewise for videos, links and other post types. Currently no other service allows this granular level of filtering which while making sharing media easy don't always help in making it effective. This is the problem Carrier Pigeon hopes to solve.
